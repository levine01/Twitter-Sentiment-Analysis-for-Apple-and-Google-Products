### Overview
This project aims to analyze Twitter sentiment regarding Apple and Google products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content, helping to understand public sentiment towards these technology giants.

### Business understanding
The real-world problem we aim to address is the need for Apple and Google to gain actionable insights from the vast amount of public sentiment expressed on Twitter. Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for these companies as it directly impacts their product development, marketing strategies, and overall brand reputation. Negative sentiment can indicate areas that need improvement, while positive sentiment can inform successful strategies.

The stakeholders in this project include Apple and Google themselves, as well as their marketing and product development teams. Additionally, shareholders, investors, and the broader consumer base interested in these companies' performance can benefit from this analysis.

Our project provides clear value to these stakeholders. By analyzing Twitter sentiment, we offer a means for Apple and Google to gauge public perception accurately. This, in turn, can help them make data-driven decisions, identify potential issues, and refine their products and marketing strategies. For instance, if negative sentiment is detected around a specific product feature, this information can guide improvements and mitigate potential PR crises.

### Data Understanding

In this section, we delve into the data that drives our sentiment analysis project focused on Apple and Google products. It's essential to establish how well this data can be leveraged to address the real-world problem of understanding public sentiment.

Our dataset originates from CrowdFlower, accessed via data.world. The choice of this dataset is highly suitable for our project's objectives. It contains over 9,000 tweets that have been manually rated for sentiment (positive, negative, or neither). These tweets serve as a valuable resource for training and testing our sentiment analysis models. Since Twitter is a prominent platform for users to express their opinions and sentiments publicly, this data represents real-world sentiment effectively.

The dataset is sufficiently large, comprising over 9,000 tweets, which ensures an ample amount of data for model training and validation. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, for all features used in the analysis, have been computed and are available. These statistics provide insights into the data's distribution and variance, aiding in model selection and interpretation.

The features used in our analysis have been carefully selected based on their properties and relevance to the project's objectives. Features such as tweet_text and emotion toward a brand or product are integral to understanding sentiment and determining the factors influencing it.

While the dataset is valuable, it does have limitations that could impact our analysis. For instance, tweet sentiment is not always straightforward to discern, as it may depend on context, sarcasm, or language nuances. Additionally, the dataset may not be fully representative of all sentiments expressed on Twitter.

### Modelling
We employ various machine learning techniques to build a robust sentiment analysis model for Twitter discussions about Apple and Google products. We begin with a baseline Naive Bayes classifier to establish a performance benchmark. After evaluating its accuracy and performance metrics, we explore Support Vector Classification (SVC) and assess its effectiveness in handling imbalanced sentiment classes. To enhance sentiment analysis, we explore Random Forest and assess its effectiveness in handling imbalanced sentiment classes. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to multiclass classification, including positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. We also investigate Naive bayes with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to improve accuracy. Our ultimate goal is to develop a reliable model that accurately categorizes public sentiment toward these tech giants' products, offering valuable insights for stakeholders and decision-makers.

### Evaluation
We have identified key factors that strongly influence public sentiment towards Apple products on Twitter. These factors include the frequency of positive and negative terms in tweets, the sentiment of specific keywords related to Apple products, and the volume of mentions and discussions. By quantifying the impact of these factors on sentiment scores, stakeholders, including Apple itself and market analysts, can gain valuable insights into the drivers of public perception.

For instance, Apple can use this information to assess the effectiveness of its marketing campaigns and product launches by monitoring how they correlate with changes in sentiment. Market analysts can leverage this data to make informed predictions about Apple's stock performance and overall market sentiment. Investors may also find value in understanding how specific events and discussions on Twitter impact the sentiment towards Apple, helping them make more informed investment decisions.

Furthermore, consumers interested in Apple products can use this sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion and make more informed purchasing choices. By considering the sentiments expressed on Twitter, they can weigh the overall positive and negative sentiment to inform their decisions, helping them choose the most suitable products based on public perception. Overall, our sentiment analysis provides actionable insights for a wide range of stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions in the context of Apple's products and public sentiment.

### Conclusion
We have successfully quantified and analyzed public sentiment towards these tech giants' products. Through the sentiment analysis, we identified key patterns and insights that can be valuable to various stakeholders, including Apple, Google, market analysts, investors, and consumers.

Our analysis revealed that public sentiment towards Apple and Google products is dynamic and influenced by various factors, including product launches, user experiences, and external events. We found that sentiment fluctuates over time, with both positive, neutral and negative sentiments being prevalent in discussions on Twitter.

For Apple, we observed that sentiment often correlates with the timing of product launches and major announcements. Positive sentiment tends to peak around product releases, while negative sentiment can arise due to product issues or controversies. This suggests that Apple can benefit from monitoring and leveraging public sentiment to inform marketing and product development strategies.

Google, on the other hand, experiences sentiment fluctuations related to various products and services, with sentiment spikes often linked to new developments or issues with products like Android, Google Search, or Google Maps. Understanding these sentiment dynamics can help Google address user concerns and improve product offerings.

In conclusion, our project highlights the importance of sentiment analysis in understanding public perception and sentiment towards technology products. The actionable insights derived from this analysis can aid companies like Apple and Google in making data-driven decisions, optimizing their products and services, and enhancing their relationships with customers. It also empowers consumers to make more informed choices based on the collective sentiment of the user community.
