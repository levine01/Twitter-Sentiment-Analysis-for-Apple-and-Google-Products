### Overview
This project aims to analyze Twitter sentiment regarding Apple and Google products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content, helping to understand public sentiment towards these technology giants.

### Business understanding
The real-world problem we aim to address is the need for Apple and Google to gain actionable insights from the vast amount of public sentiment expressed on Twitter. Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for these companies as it directly impacts their product development, marketing strategies, and overall brand reputation. Negative sentiment can indicate areas that need improvement, while positive sentiment can inform successful strategies.

The stakeholders in this project include Apple and Google themselves, as well as their marketing and product development teams. Additionally, shareholders, investors, and the broader consumer base interested in these companies' performance can benefit from this analysis.

Our project provides clear value to these stakeholders. By analyzing Twitter sentiment, we offer a means for Apple and Google to gauge public perception accurately. This, in turn, can help them make data-driven decisions, identify potential issues, and refine their products and marketing strategies. For instance, if negative sentiment is detected around a specific product feature, this information can guide improvements and mitigate potential PR crises.
