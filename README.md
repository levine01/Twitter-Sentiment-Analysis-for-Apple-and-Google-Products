### Overview
This project aims to analyze Twitter sentiment regarding Apple and Google products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content, helping to understand public sentiment towards these technology giants.

### Business understanding
The real-world problem we aim to address is the need for Apple and Google to gain actionable insights from the vast amount of public sentiment expressed on Twitter. Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for these companies as it directly impacts their product development, marketing strategies, and overall brand reputation. Negative sentiment can indicate areas that need improvement, while positive sentiment can inform successful strategies.

The stakeholders in this project include Apple and Google themselves, as well as their marketing and product development teams. Additionally, shareholders, investors, and the broader consumer base interested in these companies' performance can benefit from this analysis.

Our project provides clear value to these stakeholders. By analyzing Twitter sentiment, we offer a means for Apple and Google to gauge public perception accurately. This, in turn, can help them make data-driven decisions, identify potential issues, and refine their products and marketing strategies. For instance, if negative sentiment is detected around a specific product feature, this information can guide improvements and mitigate potential PR crises.

### Data Understanding

In this section, we delve into the data that drives our sentiment analysis project focused on Apple and Google products. It's essential to establish how well this data can be leveraged to address the real-world problem of understanding public sentiment.

Our dataset originates from CrowdFlower, accessed via data.world. The choice of this dataset is highly suitable for our project's objectives. It contains over 9,000 tweets that have been manually rated for sentiment (positive, negative, or neither). These tweets serve as a valuable resource for training and testing our sentiment analysis models. Since Twitter is a prominent platform for users to express their opinions and sentiments publicly, this data represents real-world sentiment effectively.

The dataset is sufficiently large, comprising over 9,000 tweets, which ensures an ample amount of data for model training and validation. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, for all features used in the analysis, have been computed and are available. These statistics provide insights into the data's distribution and variance, aiding in model selection and interpretation.

The features used in our analysis have been carefully selected based on their properties and relevance to the project's objectives. Features such as tweet_text and emotion toward a brand or product are integral to understanding sentiment and determining the factors influencing it.

While the dataset is valuable, it does have limitations that could impact our analysis. For instance, it's important to acknowledge that tweet sentiment is not always straightforward to discern, as it may depend on context, sarcasm, or language nuances. Additionally, the dataset may not be fully representative of all sentiments expressed on Twitter.
